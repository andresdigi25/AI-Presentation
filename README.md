# 🚀 AI-Powered Development — Address Manager API

## 📌 **Why Use AI as a Developer?**

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming software development. Instead of replacing developers, AI acts as a **supercharged assistant** — helping you write, explain, debug, and test code faster than ever.

By learning to use AI tools well, developers can:
- 🚀 Prototype ideas in minutes instead of hours.
- 🔍 Understand unfamiliar code or frameworks.
- 🧹 Automate repetitive or boilerplate tasks.
- ✅ Focus on high-value design and problem-solving.

This project and presentation show how to use AI **inside your IDE** with **[Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/)** to build real-world features step by step.

## 🤖 **Key AI Concepts**

Below are some essential AI building blocks for modern dev workflows:

### 🔑 **1️⃣ Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
LLMs like GPT-4, Ollama, or Claude are trained on billions of words and code snippets. They can understand your prompts, generate new code, and answer complex questions in natural language.

> **In Cursor:** You chat with an LLM directly in your editor.

---

### 🧩 **2️⃣ LangChain**

LangChain is a Python framework for creating **advanced AI applications** by connecting LLMs with:
- Databases
- APIs
- Files
- Tools like web browsers or custom functions.

It helps you build **smart chains** of tasks — like a chatbot that answers from your docs or a coding agent that runs code and returns results.

---

### 📚 **3️⃣ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

RAG combines two powers:
1. **Retrieval:** Finds relevant data from your own sources (PDFs, databases, websites).
2. **Generation:** Uses an LLM to write a smart answer based on the retrieved info.

This solves the **hallucination problem**: instead of guessing, the AI quotes real data.

> Example: A chatbot that answers using your uploaded CSV addresses — exactly what your API could evolve into.

---

### 🧠 **4️⃣ Memory**

Memory lets an AI keep track of **past conversations or context**. Without it, each prompt is like talking to a goldfish. With memory, AI can:
- Remember your last request.
- Refine answers over multiple steps.
- Build chatbots with real personality and history.

---

### ⚙️ **5️⃣ n8n**

**n8n** is an open-source workflow automation tool. Think of it as **Zapier** but more flexible. In AI, you can use n8n to:
- Automate triggers (e.g., new CSV → call your API → get AI summary)
- Chain multiple AI calls together
- Integrate LLMs into larger business workflows

---

### 🌍 **6️⃣ Foundational Models**

Foundational Models are huge pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for many tasks:
- Text generation (GPT)
- Image generation (Stable Diffusion, DALL·E)
- Code generation (Codex, Cursor’s LLM)
- Multimodal AI (text + image + audio)

They’re called “foundational” because they’re the base for specialized apps.

## ✅ **What This Project Demonstrates**

In this repo, you’ll find a practical FastAPI project:
- Upload address data in CSV or JSON.
- Store it in a database.
- Secure it with JWT authentication.
- Perform CRUD operations.
- **All created step by step using an AI IDE (Cursor)!**

This is a real example of how AI accelerates development — so you spend less time writing boilerplate and more time solving real problems.

---

## 🎓 **How to Try It**

1️⃣ Install [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/)  
2️⃣ Open this repo in Cursor.  
3️⃣ Use the provided prompts in the presentation to:
   - Generate endpoints
   - Add auth
   - Explain and debug code
   - Refactor as needed
